# Car-Checker-NN
Neural network to check if a vehicle exists in an image.

Work and testing was all done in google colab

testimages folder contains 50 small images that I did the majority of my testing with.
They are named such that the automatic functional accuracy calculation will work on the
project. You just need to read them in with the google file upload.
folder contains 25 vehicle images and 25 other non-vehicle images.

Any other images will work too, I included these for convenience

Created using CIFAR 10 image set.
